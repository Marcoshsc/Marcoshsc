## Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my Github Profile!
 
### I'm fascinated by life, I love to learn, program and play games!

My name is Marcos, I'm graduating at Information Systems on the Federal University of Ouro Preto ([UFOP](https://ufop.br/)). I also work in a scientific research project which tries to solve the schoolar bus routing problem, using geolocation technologies and modern stacks (spring boot, react) in order to develop algorithms and apps that will potentially change the way schoolar transportation is seen today.

My story as a developer started in early 2018, when I was at the last high school year, and started an algorithm course, using Portugol. Since then, I found that programming was awesome, and that it was what I wanted to work with. I started learning all kinds of technologies, everything related to coding was welcome. In 2019, I started my graduation at UFOP, and my software development skills have grown significantly till today. Today I'm a Full Stack web developer, with experience using java (Spring framework, Hibernate and other popular Java libraries), and the ReactJS environment (React, React with Typescript, redux libraries, etc.). I also worked with geolocation technologies, such as PostGIS, leaflet and OpenStreetMaps-based projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on geolocation projects, Scientific Research for UFOP
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react-leaflet, redux

- âš¡ Fun fact: At a given time, I thought that HTML was a programming language and Javascript was a Java-based language! :laughing:
